# MATLAB_miscellaneous_codes

These are pieces of MATLAB code that I have written over the years for various projects. The scripts range in purpose, from implementing subsampling/bootstrapping procedures on time series data (particularlly EEG brain rhythm signals), to loading/processing/scoring different kinds of data, working with and manipulating various MATLAB data structures/objects, and performing post-hoc fixes to rectify issues that occurred during data collection. Some scripts are fully written by me, while others I contributed to by adding functions and fixing bugs as part of my role as co-maintainer of an open-source MATLAB psychophysiology processing and statistical analysis toolbox (these scripts begin with PTB_).
